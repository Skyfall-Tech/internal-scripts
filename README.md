## Internal Scripts
#### Why is this repo public if they are internal scripts?
**The reason it is public is because these are the scripts we use internally that we don't mind sharing with the world.** That said, we are not responsible for keeping it up to date with the cutting edge, adding support for myriad other things, and we may even leave things in the scripts that will only ever work on our own stuff. That's fine with use. Feel free to fork and adapt the scripts however you see fit for your own use.
